        "long_desc": "Robot Operating System is an open-source robotics middleware suite used to make / simulate complex robots and test out Robotics algorithms without the need of much know-how on the algorithms behind because of which we can focus more on the implementation and application side. Even though ROS helps us to implement and simulate complex algorithms, It has a steep learning curve. With this Workshop I plan to provide a basic introduction on what ROS is and how to start making robots with ROS. The workshop will also include a handson session on working with a simulator called turtlesim with which the basics of ROS can be learned. I will also be demoing a ROS based Autonomous Navigation Robot built by me to further give clarity on the learned concepts.",
